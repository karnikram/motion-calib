<h1 align="center">Motion-Based Camera-IMU Extrinsic Calibration</h1>
An implementation of Zachary Taylor's <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyTaylor/ICRA2015-Calibration-Code">work</a> to estimate the rigid body pose between a camera and an IMU by applying the Kabsch algorithm to their motion estimates.
